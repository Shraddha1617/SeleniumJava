 
 in config.properties
 we use highlight
 highlight the element
 how you will highlight the element means which utility you will use
 Javascript utility
 
 highlight = true---> it will highlight the element
 
 remote = true ---> means execute your test cases on selenium grid 
 selenium grid could be hosted on any server like local, AWS or cloud also
 
 
 In "Page" classes (like LoginPage.java) 
 whenever you are creating a page or a feature for that page so the feature have been writen in
 page classes 
 feature in the form of methods
 like doLogin
 just perform some action or feature in the form of page action or page method we have to write
 we should never assert inside the page class
 page class is not responsible for any validation
 Page class give you the behaviour of the application/ behaviour of the object, webelement 
 its your TestNG(Test class) responsibility to do the assertion 
 
 Inside the "Test" Class
 we never use driver API like driver.findElement, wedriver utility or wait
 TestNG class just call the respective methods and assert it 
 
 SRB--->Single Responsiblity pattern says we should have the component or seperate class 
 in terms of java
 we should have a seperate class to handle a specific scenario/feature
 
 Thread Local:
 to manage the thread
 you have multiple tcs
 u genertaed 3 thread means 3 threads (browser) will be open at one time
 
 XML file
 Test block we write and it is based on our Test classes
 suppose we are having 3 Test page classes then in xml we have to write the 3 test block
 thread-count = 3 means 3 browser will be open in a parallel mode
 
 <parameter name="browser" value="chrome" />
 this is we are reading in BaseTest	 
 
 maven-compiler-plugin---> used to compile the code 
 whatever code we have written inside the src/main/java and src/test/java it will check
 is everything is fine or not
 
 maven-surefire-plugin---> used to run the code which is inside the src/test/java
 
 
 pom.xml is always available root of the project
 command---> mvn clean install
 this command go to the pom.xml file with the maven-compiler-plugin first it will compile the entire code
 and once compilation is done it will pick the test cases with the help of maven-surefire-plugin
 it will go to perticular xml file 
 
 mvn clean install -D (-D is used in maven to provide the env variable)
 mvn clean install -Denv="qa"
 
 Listner is a testNG feature
 it is a parallel activity which is going on along with your execution  from the testng
